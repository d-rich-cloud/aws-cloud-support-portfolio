# Linux & macOS CLI Basics (For Cloud Support)

These are core terminal/command-line concepts and commands that work on **Linux** and **macOS**. I am practicing them on my MacBook Pro so they transfer directly to working with Linux servers (like AWS EC2 instances).

## 1. Getting Started

### Open the Terminal (macOS)

- Open **Spotlight** using `Cmd + Space`
- Type `Terminal` and press `Enter`

On Linux servers, you usually connect via SSH and then get a similar shell.

## 2. Where Am I? (Current Directory)

- Show current directory:

```bash
pwd
