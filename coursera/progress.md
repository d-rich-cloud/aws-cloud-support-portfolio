# Coursera Progress – Cloud Technology Consultant Professional Certificate

This file tracks my progress through the multi-course **Cloud Technology Consultant Professional Certificate** on Coursera.

## Course 1: Introduction to AWS Cloud Careers

✅ **Status:** Completed

### What I Learned

- The main types of cloud roles:
  - Cloud Support / Operations
  - Cloud Engineer / Architect
  - Cloud Consultant
  - DevOps / SRE (Site Reliability)
- How cloud support fits into the bigger picture of cloud adoption.
- The basic value of cloud for businesses:
  - Reduced upfront cost
  - Scalability and elasticity
  - Global reach and managed services

### Why This Matters for My Career

- Helped me confirm that **AWS Cloud Support / AMS** is a good fit:
  - I like problem solving, documentation, and helping others use technology.
  - I prefer improving/maintaining systems over building complex applications from scratch.

## Course 2: Introduction to Information Technology and AWS Cloud

✅ **Status:** In progress (~ 2/3 complete)

### Key Topics Covered So Far

- **IT Foundations**
  - What servers, operating systems, networks, and storage are.
  - The difference between on-premises infrastructure and cloud infrastructure.
- **Basic Networking Concepts**
  - IP addresses, ports, protocols (e.g., HTTP, SSH).
  - How these concepts apply when connecting to cloud resources.
- **AWS Basics**
  - High-level overview of services like EC2, S3, RDS, and IAM.
  - How AWS global infrastructure is organized (Regions, Availability Zones).

### How This Prepares Me for Cloud Support

- I’m building the mental model to:
  - Understand where a problem might be: network, OS, app, or configuration.
  - Talk to both technical and non-technical people about cloud issues.
- I’m starting to map **traditional IT concepts** (servers, storage, networks) to **AWS services** (EC2, EBS, VPC, S3).

## Next Steps

- Finish **"Introduction to Information Technology and AWS Cloud"**.
- Start applying concepts in hands-on labs and documenting them in:
  - `/labs` – for practical exercises
  - `/runbooks` – for support-style troubleshooting guides
